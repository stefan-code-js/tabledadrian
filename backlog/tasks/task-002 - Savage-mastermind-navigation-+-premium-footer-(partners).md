## Description

<!-- SECTION:DESCRIPTION:BEGIN -->
Replace the nav with a command-palette style overlay (desktop + mobile): minimal header bar with “Menu”. Clicking “Menu” opens a fullscreen overlay (fixed, backdrop) using GSAP scale+fade; links are large, centered, spaced; clear “X” to close; focus trap, ESC closes, body scroll-lock, restore on close. Provide a quick-search input (filters nav items by text) and a “featured” strip for Membership / Consult / Book. Active route underline using usePathname(). No sticky nav. Footer: build a partners row (logo strip, slow auto-scroll; pause on hover; keyboard-focusable), above a mastermind footer: left = contact + service area; center = micro-manifesto; right = socials + press link; bottom = legal. All monochrome + accents; no borders; elegant rules only where needed.
