## Description

<!-- SECTION:DESCRIPTION:BEGIN -->
You’re allowed to add, remove, or change the structure of every page for the best experience. Replace layout with editorial sections: cinematic full-bleed hero → asymmetric image+copy sequences → pull quotes → slim CTA bands → gallery/press teasers. Inject KineticHeading/Paragraph and KeywordHighlighter where copy benefits; highlight our key words (e.g., “private table”, “Côte d’Azur”, “seasonal”, “membership”, “consult”, “chef’s table”) with accent colors triggered on scroll. Keep content dense, aligned, persuasive; no dead space; allow minimal cards only where UX requires. Wire every CTA with exact routes; no dead ends.
