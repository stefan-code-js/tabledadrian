# Table d'Adrian – Private Chef & Luxury Dining Experiences Worldwide

Table d'Adrian delivers Michelin-caliber private chef services that transform villas, penthouses, yachts, and private jets into ephemeral dining rooms. Chef Adrian and his cadre of hospitality artisans choreograph every detail so discerning hosts in Monaco, Miami, New York City, Dubai, Abu Dhabi, London, Courchevel, Geneva, and beyond experience a luxury dining journey without leaving their residences. Each engagement is a bespoke gastronomic experience shaped by seasonality, terroir, and the desires of your guest list.

## The Experience
A Table d'Adrian evening feels like commissioning a fleeting work of culinary art. Candlelight frames porcelain, crystal, and linen curated for the venue, while a personal chef team conducts an orchestra of aroma, texture, and temperature that responds to the rhythm of your gathering. Personal preferences, wellness goals, and cultural inspirations inform every course—whether a multi-act dégustation, a progressive Riviera supper, or an avant-garde tasting that spans continents. Reduced-motion guests, ceremonial service, and fluid pacing are all considered so conversation, music, and atmosphere remain effortless.

## Services & Offerings
Table d'Adrian designs bespoke events for private residences, superyachts, luxury resorts, and brand collaborations. Each commission is supported by sommeliers, butlers, florists, mixologists, and stylists who understand white-glove etiquette.

### Private Chef in Monaco and Beyond
Hosts in Monaco, Saint-Jean-Cap-Ferrat, and along the French and Italian Riviera commission Table d'Adrian for Michelin-level artistry at home. The same private chef in Monaco for exclusive events can appear in Manhattan townhouses, Palm Island villas in Miami, sky suites in Dubai, or alpine estates in Courchevel—complete with in-house staffing, rentals coordination, and silent service.

### Gastronomic Experiences for Global Brands
Luxury maisons, supercar marques, and fine jewelry houses engage Table d'Adrian to curate bespoke events that extend brand storytelling through cuisine. Multisensory tasting rooms, atelier dinners, and art-inspired menus reinforce the narrative of each partnership.

## Chef Adrian's Journey
Chef Adrian refined his craft at the Ecole hoteliere de Lausanne before joining the brigades of Oetker Collection's Hotel du Cap-Eden-Roc, the K2 Palace in Courchevel, and Mondrian Cannes. He staged and led culinary teams for amfAR Galas, private Dior dinners, and five-star ocean liners serving UHNW clientele. This trajectory forged a chef-for-hire capable of delivering Michelin-caliber service anywhere in the world with the discretion, timing, and anticipatory service expected by elite hosts.
