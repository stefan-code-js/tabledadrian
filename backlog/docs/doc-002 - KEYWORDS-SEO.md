# Codex Prompt for Table d'Adrian SEO Content

## Background
Table d'Adrian is a luxury private chef and events service led by Chef Adrian. Originally based on the Cote d'Azur, it has evolved into a globally available culinary experience with no constraints on cuisine. The brand now embraces an inclusive, omnivorous repertoire and focuses on personalized, high-end gastronomic experiences ranging from intimate private dining to ultra-high-net-worth events and exclusive brand collaborations delivered worldwide. Every engagement must embody Michelin-caliber craftsmanship and artistry.

## Brand Highlights
- **Culinary Maestro:** Chef Adrian is an Ecole hoteliere de Lausanne alumnus who refined his craft at Oetker Collection's 1★ Michelin Hotel du Cap-Eden-Roc, the K2 Palace in Courchevel, Mondrian Cannes, luxury cruises, and marquee events including the amfAR Gala and private Dior dinners. This pedigree ensures Michelin-level excellence in every dish.
- **Bespoke Experiences:** Table d'Adrian crafts immersive culinary journeys. Each commission is tailor-made—from in-home private chef services and yacht dining to lavish UHNW celebrations and gastronomic collaborations—blending global flavors, seasonal ingredients, and artistic presentation to tell a story that lingers beyond the final course.
- **Global Availability:** Headquartered on the French Riviera yet available worldwide, Chef Adrian serves Monaco, Miami, New York City, Dubai, Abu Dhabi, London, Courchevel, Geneva, and any destination seeking restaurant-level luxury in private villas, yachts, chalets, and estates.

## Important Guidelines
- **No Dietary Restrictions Messaging:** Reflect an inclusive, omnivorous cuisine. Remove any references to previous meat-free positioning. Emphasize a global palette (French Riviera terroir, Asian influences, Middle Eastern spices, etc.) without labeling the experience vegetarian-only.
- **Retired Concepts:** Omit the Alchemy Series, Club memberships, or any legacy programs. Focus messaging on private chef services and bespoke events.
- **Consistent Luxury Tone:** Maintain an ultra-refined, exclusive voice. Even while optimizing for SEO, avoid casual phrasing or language that dilutes the luxury positioning.

## SEO Objectives
### Global SEO Expansion
Naturally reference high-end hubs—Monaco, Miami, New York City, Dubai, Abu Dhabi, London, Courchevel, Geneva—within the narrative to capture worldwide search intent beyond the Cote d'Azur.

### Targeted & Long-Tail Keywords
- Integrate core terms: Table d'Adrian, private chef, luxury dining experience, bespoke events, in-home private chef, chef for hire, gastronomic experiences.
- Weave long-tail phrases contextually (e.g., "Table d'Adrian private chef in Monaco for exclusive events", "bespoke culinary experience in Dubai", "private chef for luxury yachts").
- Ensure each service is clearly described for both SEO relevance and user clarity.
- Prioritize the exact phrase "private chef" over synonyms. Use brand name "Table d'Adrian" consistently.

## Tone and Style
Write with Michelin-level elegance—evocative, poetic, and sensory. Treat each paragraph as if art-directed by dozens of creative directors: vivid imagery, emotive language, and storytelling that positions Table d'Adrian as a collectible culinary art form. Highlight tailored hospitality, EHL training, and white-glove etiquette to underscore exclusivity and warmth. Avoid technical or platform jargon; keep vocabulary strictly within the luxury private chef and bespoke dining domain.
